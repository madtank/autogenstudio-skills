# Vision Plugin Integration Guide

This document outlines the steps required to integrate a vision plugin into the application, enabling the feature to upload and view images.

## Setup and Configuration

1. **API Key Configuration**: To use the vision plugin, you must first obtain an API key from the vision service provider. This key will be used to authenticate requests to the vision service.

2. **Environment Variable**: Store your API key in an environment variable for security. For example, in a Unix-based system, you can add the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:
   ```bash
   export VISION_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
   ```

3. **Integration in Application**: In your application, access the API key through the environment variable. This ensures that the key is not hard-coded into your application code.

## Using the Vision Plugin

To use the vision plugin for uploading and viewing images, follow these steps:

1. **File Upload**: Implement a file upload feature in your application. This allows users to upload images that they want to view with the vision plugin.

2. **Image Processing**: Once an image is uploaded, use the vision plugin to process the image. This might involve sending a request to the vision service's API, including the image data and your API key for authentication.

3. **Displaying the Image**: After processing, the vision plugin will return the processed image or a link to the image. Display this image in your application for the user to view.

## Example Code

Here is an example of how you might set up a simple image viewing feature using the vision plugin:

```python
import os
import requests

def view_uploaded_image(image_path):
    api_key = os.getenv('VISION_API_KEY')
    vision_api_url = 'https://visionapi.example.com/process'

    with open(image_path, 'rb') as image_file:
        image_data = image_file.read()

    response = requests.post(vision_api_url, headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}'}, files={'image': image_data})

    if response.status_code == 200:
        # Assuming the API returns a direct link to the processed image
        processed_image_url = response.json().get('processed_image_url')
        print(f"View the processed image here: {processed_image_url}")
    else:
        print("Failed to process the image with the vision plugin.")
```

Replace `'https://visionapi.example.com/process'` with the actual API endpoint provided by your vision service.

## Conclusion

Integrating a vision plugin into your application enhances its capabilities, allowing for advanced image processing and viewing features. Ensure that you securely manage your API keys and follow the service provider's guidelines for using their API.
